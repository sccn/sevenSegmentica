sevenSegmentica is a plugin for EEGLAB developed by Makoto Miyakoshi. This is an exceptional case of EEGLAB plugins because it is not for processing EEG data. Instead, I developed sevenSegmentica as a demonstration (Youtube demo here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGOw04Ukqws&t=2s) and simulation study for infomax ICA. It is quite fun to play with input parameters to see whether readable numbers emerges in the result. The key idea in this development is that we can intuitively tell whether the decomposition was success or failure.
